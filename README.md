### Title - Utility-web

##### Why the title?

Because it is a utility web application

##### What does it do?

I am not sure yet but I believe it wil be a small project that would contain the following:

- [x] A full-fledged notes application. This is already being worked on and is already available to use. It uses the tinymce editor. I actually really like the editor.

- [] A calculator. This calculator will be multifunctional. Nothing has been decided yet.

- [] An up to date currency converter. Probably would use a library to do that. 

- [] A chat application. Also not done yet but it will be cool to understand web sockets. That technology has been very difficult for me to wrap my head around.


##### Why am I doing this?

Most, if not all of my projects have been failures. Either I don't know enough to continue working on them or I lose the motivation to continue on the project. 

Also, this is my second time writing an expressive readme. I hope it is expressive enough

##### Technologies used?

* Next.js App Router 
* Tailwind css
* tinymce
* radix ui
